# Welcome to the FreeMoCap 

Its 24 July 2022, and I'm just playing around with `mkdocs` right now. Seems pretty cool!

We're planning to build a Knowledge Base that roughly follows the [structure outlined here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xk15eYjGnGjuUlPOJgSoF2z5fhktZXMHNP_00blWi_s/edit#slide=id.gac39de1498_0_345)

...but until then, I'm just going to point you back to the (`README.md`) in the main repository:
https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap

We've also got a pretty nice website:
https://freemocap.org

Work in progress, stay tuned!!
