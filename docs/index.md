# Welcome to the FreeMoCap 

I'm just playing around with `mkdocs` right now

Seems pretty cool!

Until we actually put together a proper Knowledge Base, I'm just going to point you back to the (`README.md`) in the main repository:

We've also got a pretty nice website: 

https://freemocap.org

Work in progress, stay tuned!!
